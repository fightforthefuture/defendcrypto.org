        innovation</a>.
      Kin is unwilling to let that happen and is setting aside $5MM with
      Coinbase Custody to take them on in court. But with the future of crypto 
      on the line, $5MM might not be enough. That's why we are asking others to 
      contribute so that nothing gets left on the table.

  what_title: What’s happening?
  what_description: |
    Despite the fact that last month over 250,000 people earned and spent Kin as
    a currency, the SEC is still saying that it might be a security. After
    months of trying to find a reasonable solution, Kin has been unable to reach
    a settlement that wouldn’t severely impact the Kin project ... and everyone 
    else in the crypto space, too. So Kin is going to take on the SEC in court to 
    make sure a legal precedent for innovation is established going forward.
  why_title: Why does it matter?
  why_description:
    For the future of crypto, we all need Kin to win. This will be the new Howey Test
    for how cryptocurrencies are regulated in the United States. That’s why
    Kin set up the Defend Crypto fund to ensure that the funds are there to do
    this the right way. Kin has already spent over $5MM and is committing
    another $5MM of BTC, ETH, and KIN in a Coinbase Custody account to fight
    this out on behalf of the industry.

    <h4>
      If you too are fed up with this innovation tax, we encourage you to
      contribute also as we take on the SEC on behalf of the future of crypto
      in the US. Any additional contributions will be held with Coinbase Custody
      and will only be used if that $5MM isn’t enough. In that case, expenses
      will be disclosed, and &mdash; after a court decision is made &mdash; the 
      Defend Crypto fund will allocate the remaining resources to other initiatives. 
      <strong>We need to let the SEC know that we won’t be bullied around anymore. It
      is time to Defend Crypto.</strong>

      - question: How will I know that you are using the funds as you say?
        answer: We will be open and transparent about how we are spending funds, which is intended to be used in the legal case against Kik initially. Kik has already spent over $5MM on legal fees and expenses associated with responding to the SEC’s inquiries, document productions and witness testimony. Although we won’t share actual legal bills because they contain privileged information, we will share summaries and amounts billed on a monthly basis.
      - question: If I contribute, will it affect my project legally?
        answer: Obviously, we can’t promise that any other project that conducted an ICO will not be investigated or sued by the SEC. If you’re worried about being targeted because of your contribution to this defense fund, you can always donate anonymously.
      - question: Can my contribution be anonymous?
        answer: Yes. If you wish to remain anonymous, we recommend that you don’t complete the email portion and that you use a separate public address from which to send your contribution.
      - question: If the funds are not used, what will be done with them?
        answer: Once the case against Kik is finally resolved, all remaining funds, including any portion of the $5 million in BTC, ETH and KIN that we’ve contributed, will be rolled into a nonprofit organization to be used for other initiatives that help with innovation in our industry.
