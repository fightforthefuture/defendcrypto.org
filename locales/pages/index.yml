      <span style="font-weight: bold;">      UPDATE: Kik has filed their Answer to the SEC Complaint, spanning
       130 pages and refuting the allegations paragraph-by-paragraph. You can
      read the response in full here: 
      <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/420996750/2019-08-06-Answer-dckt-22-0">Answer to Complaint US Securities and Exchange Commission v. Kik Interactive Inc.</a></span>
      <br>
      <br>
      The SEC has been shaping the future of crypto behind the scenes with
      settlements that set a dangerous precedent and stifle
      <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-how-we-howey-050919" target="_blank">
        innovation</a>.
      <br>
      <br>
      Kik is unwilling to let that happen and has created DefendCrypto, a fund dedicated to 
      supporting legal initiatives that impact the crypto industry. It is not just
      Kik that is impacted by the regulatory uncertainty. Many other projects are
      facing pressure behind the scenes, and many do not have the resources to
      fight and are being forced to simply fold and walk away.  That is why Kik,
      along with other contributors, have already donated $2MM to assisting other
      projects that are dealing with fights of their own, and is calling on others to do the same.
      <br>
      <br>
      In order to assure that DefendCrypto is governed fairly, all use of proceeds will be overseen by
      the <a href="https://theblockchainassociation.org/" targe"_blank">Blockchain Association</a>, which
      is an organization advocating for innovation and collaboration
      in this pivotal new industry.

  what_html: |
    <p>
      On June 4, 2019, the SEC filed an enforcement action against Kik for its 2017 distribution of
      the KIN token. This comes after months of Kik trying to find a reasonable settlement that wouldn’t
      severely impact the project and everyone in the space.
      <br>
      <br>
      In January 2019, Kik came out publicly to share what has been going on
      <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/are-ico-tokens-securities-startup-wants-a-judge-to-decide-11548604800" target="_blank">
        behind the scenes</a>
      with the SEC. At that time the SEC was asserting claims against Kik and the Kin Foundation, 
      but the recent enforcement action only cites Kik and its role in the distribution of Kin in September 2017. 
      <br>
      <br>
      That is a big step forward as it shows that Kin today - which is earned and spent by over 500k people per
      month - is not a security. But it still does not give clear guidance on how decentralized networks should
      be launched and put in the hands of consumers.
      <br>
      <br>
      This has been a burden for not just Kik, but many others in the space who are optimizing for regulation
      before innovation. So Kik is going to take on the SEC in court to make sure there is a foundation for
      innovation going forward. Many others are on the path to do the same, and will need our support.
    </p>
  why_title: Why does it matter?
  why_html: |
    <p>
      For the future of crypto, we all need Kik to win. This case will set a precedent
      and could serve as the new
      <a href="https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/framework-investment-contract-analysis-digital-assets" target="_blank">
        Howey Test</a>
      for how cryptocurrencies are regulated in the United States.
      <br>
      <br>
      This may be the first case but it won’t be the only case. That’s why we set up the Defend Crypto fund, 
      to ensure that the funds are there for the industry to work together to do this the right way. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Kik has already spent over $6MM taking on the SEC and has committed another $5MM to help bring
      the regulatory clarity the industry needs to light. There are many others facing pressure behind
      the scenes that don't have the resources to take a stand, so Kik has also committed an additional
      $2MM to help those take on their own important fights.

    <p>
      If you too are fed up with this innovation tax, we encourage you to contribute also as 
      we take on the SEC on behalf of the future of crypto in the US. Any contributions will
      be allocated to initiatives that promote regulatory clarity and allow for responsible innovation.

    <p>
    The SEC first reached out to Kik three days after the token sale, and since then Kik has continued to comply with all of their requests and work hard to find a path forward with the SEC.
    <br>
    <br>
    Despite the regulatory overhang, the Kin ecosystem continues to grow with more and more developers building with Kin, and more and more people using Kin as a currency.
    <br>
    <br>
    Below is a timeline of events going all the way back to the token sale. During this entire time, Kik has been trying to find a reasonable settlement but has been unable to do so.
