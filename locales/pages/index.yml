    <p>
      The SEC has been shaping the future of crypto behind the scenes with
      settlements that set a dangerous precedent and stifle
      <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-how-we-howey-050919" target="_blank">
        innovation</a>.
      <br>
      <br>
      Kin is unwilling to let that happen and is setting aside $5MM with
      Coinbase to take them on in court.
      <br>
      <br>
      But with the future of crypto on the line,
      $5MM might not be enough. That's why we're calling on others to contribute to
      the Defend Crypto fund.

    <p>
      In January 2019, Kin came out publicly to share what has been going on
      <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/are-ico-tokens-securities-startup-wants-a-judge-to-decide-11548604800" target="_blank">
        behind the scenes</a>
      with the SEC. This has been a burden for not just Kin, but many others in the
      space who are optimizing for regulation before innovation. Everyone is always
      asking “what will the SEC think?” instead of “what is best for consumers?”
      <br>
      <br>
      Despite the fact that last month over 300,000 people earned and spent Kin as a
      currency, the SEC is still saying that it might be a security. After months of
      trying to find a reasonable solution, Kin has been unable to reach a settlement
      that wouldn’t severely impact the Kin project and everyone in the space. So Kin
      is going to take on the SEC in court to make sure there is a foundation for
      innovation going forward.

  why_title: Why does it matter?

    <p>
      For the future of crypto, we all need Kin to win. This case will set a precedent
      and could serve as the new
      <a href="https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/framework-investment-contract-analysis-digital-assets" target="_blank">
        Howey Test</a>
      for how cryptocurrencies are regulated in the United States. That’s why Kin set
      up the Defend Crypto fund to ensure that the funds are there to do this the right
      way. Kin has already spent over $5MM and is committing another $5MM of BTC, ETH,
      and KIN in a Coinbase account to fight this out on behalf of the industry.
    </p>
  action_title: What can you do?
  action_html: |
    <p>
      If you too are fed up with this innovation tax, we encourage you to
      contribute also as we take on the SEC on behalf of the future of crypto
      in the US. Any additional contributions will be held with Coinbase and
      will only be used if that $5MM isn’t enough. In that case, expenses
      will be disclosed, and &mdash; after a court decision is made &mdash; the
      Defend Crypto fund will allocate the remaining resources to other initiatives.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>We need to let the SEC know that we won’t be pushed around anymore.
      It is time to Defend Crypto.</strong>

  how_description_html: |
    <p>
    The SEC first reached out three days after the token sale, and since then Kin has
    continued to comply with all of their requests and work hard to find a path forward
    with the SEC.
    <br>
    <br>
    Despite the regulatory overhang, the Kin ecosystem continues to grow
    with more and more developers building with Kin, and more and more people using Kin
    as a currency.
    <br>
    <br>
    Below is a timeline of events going all the way back to the token sale.
    During this entire time, Kin has been trying to find a reasonable settlement but has
    been unable to do so.

    title: FAQs
    items:
      - question: How will I know that you are using the funds as you say?
        answer: >
          We will be open and transparent about how we are spending funds, which
          is intended to be used in the legal case against Kin initially. Kin
          has already spent over $5MM on legal fees and expenses associated with
          responding to the SEC’s inquiries, document productions and witness
          testimony. Although we won’t share actual legal bills because they
          contain privileged information, we will share summaries and amounts
          billed on a monthly basis.
      - question: Is my contribution anonymous?
        answer: >
          Yes. All contributions are anonymous by nature. The email sign up is
          not specifically tied to contributions.
      - question: If I contribute, will it affect my project legally?
        answer: >
          If you’re worried about being targeted because of your contribution to
          this defense fund, all contributions are anonymous and not disclosed
          publicly.
      - question: If the funds are not used, what will be done with them?
        answer: >
          Once the case against Kin is finally resolved, all remaining funds,
          including any portion of the $5MM in BTC, ETH and KIN that we’ve
          contributed, will be rolled into a nonprofit organization to be used
          for other initiatives that help with innovation in our industry.
      - question: Is my contribution tax deductible?
        answer: >
          No, contributions are not tax deductible, and you should consult with
          your own tax advisors regarding the impact of making a contribution.
