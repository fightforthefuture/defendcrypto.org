    <h4>
      The SEC has been shaping the future of crypto behind the scenes with
      settlements that set a dangerous precedent and could
      <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-how-we-howey-050919" target="_blank">
        push innovation offshore</a>.
      Kin is unwilling to let that happen and is setting aside $5mm with
      Coinbase Custody to take them on in court. But with so much on the line
      $5mm might not be enough, so we are asking others to contribute so that
      nothing gets left on the table.

  what_title: What’s happening?
  what_description: |
    Despite the fact that last month over 250,000 people earned and spent Kin as
    a currency, the SEC continues to say even that isn’t a security. After
    months of trying to find a reasonable solution Kin has been unable to reach
    a settlement that wouldn’t severely impact everyone in the space. So Kin is
    going to take on the SEC in court to make sure there is a foundation for
    innovation going forward.
  why_title: Why does it matter?
  why_description:
    For the future of crypto, we all need Kin to win. This will be the new Howey
    Test for how cryptocurrencies are regulated in the United States. That’s why
    we set up the Defend Crypto fund to ensure that the funds are there to do
    this the right way. Kin has already spent over $5mm and is committing
    another $5mm of BTC, ETH, and KIN in a Coinbase Custody account to fight
    this out on behalf of the industry.

    <h4>
      If you too are fed up with this innovation tax, we encourage you to
      contribute also as we take on the SEC on behalf of the future of crypto
      in the US. Any additional contributions will be held with Coinbase Custody
      and will only be used if that $5mm isn’t enough. In that case, expenses
      will be open sourced, and any unspent contributions will be returned
      pro-rata after a court decision is made.

      We need to let the SEC know that we won’t be bullied around anymore. It
      is time to Defend Crypto.
