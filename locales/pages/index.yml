      <span style="font-weight: bold;">UPDATE: Kik is allocating all funds in excess of its initial $5MM commitment to other projects
      taking on their own fight and the Blockchain Association is coming on board to govern the fund.
      More details here: <a href="https://medium.com/@tanner.philp/defend-crypto-expanding-the-reach-and-impact-with-the-blockchain-association-70be168d775f?postPublishedType=initial" target="_blank">Defend Crypto: Expanding the Reach and Impact with the Blockchain Association</a>

      <br>
      The SEC has been shaping the future of crypto behind the scenes with
      settlements that set a dangerous precedent and stifle
      <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-how-we-howey-050919" target="_blank">
        innovation</a>.</span>
      <br>
      <br>
      Kik is unwilling to let that happen so has set aside $5MM in a separate Coinbase account to take
      them on in court. But it is not just Kik that is impacted by the regulatory uncertainty. Many other
      projects are facing pressure behind the scenes. Many of which don’t have the resources to fight and
      are being forced to simply fold and walk away.
      <br>
      <br>
      So going forward, the Defend Crypto fund will be dedicated to helping other projects outside of Kik
      in their fight to Defend Crypto. Kik has moved its initial $5MM commitment into a separate account
      and has committed an additional $2MM to the Defend Crypto fund, along with the other outside contributions,
      and is calling on others to do the same. All contributions will be governed by the 
      <a href="https://theblockchainassociation.org/" targe"_blank">Blockchain Association</a> and will go towards
      other litigation that impacts the broader crypto industry.

    <p>
      On June 4, 2019, the SEC filed an enforcement action against Kik for its 2017 distribution of
      the KIN token. This comes after months of Kik trying to find a reasonable settlement that wouldn’t
      severely impact the project and everyone in the space.
      <br>
      <br>
      In January 2019, Kik came out publicly to share what has been going on
      <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/are-ico-tokens-securities-startup-wants-a-judge-to-decide-11548604800" target="_blank">
        behind the scenes</a>
      with the SEC. At that time the SEC was asserting claims against Kik and the Kin Foundation, 
      but the recent enforcement action only cites Kik and its role in the distribution of Kin in September 2017. 
      <br>
      <br>
      That is a big step forward as it shows that Kin today - which is earned and spent by over 500k people per
      month - is not a security. But it still does not give clear guidance on how decentralized networks should
      be launched and put in the hands of consumers.
      <br>
      <br>
      This has been a burden for not just Kik, but many others in the space who are optimizing for regulation
      before innovation. So Kik is going to take on the SEC in court to make sure there is a foundation for
      innovation going forward. Many others are on the path to do the same, and will need our support.

  why_title: Why does it matter?
  why_html: |
    <p>
      For the future of crypto, we all need Kik to win. This case will set a precedent
      and could serve as the new
      <a href="https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/framework-investment-contract-analysis-digital-assets" target="_blank">
        Howey Test</a>
      for how cryptocurrencies are regulated in the United States.
      <br>
      <br>
      This may be the first case but it won’t be the only case. That’s why we set up the Defend Crypto fund, 
      to ensure that the funds are there for the industry to work together to do this the right way. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Kin has already spent over $5MM and is committing another $5MM of BTC, ETH,
      and KIN in our Coinbase account to fight this out on behalf of the industry. Many others 
      don’t have those resources and will need our support. Kik has allocated an additional $500k 
      of Kin to other projects, along with the appreciation on its initial $5MM commitment. 
    </p>

      If you too are fed up with this innovation tax, we encourage you to contribute also as 
      we take on the SEC on behalf of the future of crypto in the US. Any contributions will
      be allocated to initiatives that promote regulatory clarity and allow for responsible innovation.

    <p>
    The SEC first reached out to Kik three days after the token sale, and since then Kik has continued to comply with all of their requests and work hard to find a path forward with the SEC.
    <br>
    <br>
    Despite the regulatory overhang, the Kin ecosystem continues to grow with more and more developers building with Kin, and more and more people using Kin as a currency.
    <br>
    <br>
    Below is a timeline of events going all the way back to the token sale. During this entire time, Kik has been trying to find a reasonable settlement but has been unable to do so.
