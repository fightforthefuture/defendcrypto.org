    SITE TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
    <p>Last Modified: May 24, 2019</p>
    <p><b>Acceptance of the Terms of Use</b></p>
    <p>DefendCrypto.org and DefendCrypto.com (the “Website”) is operated by Kik Interactive Inc., a Canadian corporation (together with our affiliates, “Kik”, “us”, we” or “our”).  </p>
    <p>WE WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THESE TERMS INCLUDE AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WHICH WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, REQUIRE DISPUTES BETWEEN US TO BE SUBMITTED TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION. UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT: (1) YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TO PURSUE CLAIMS AND SEEK RELIEF AGAINST US ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING; AND (2) YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO SEEK RELIEF IN A COURT OF LAW AND TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL ON YOUR CLAIMS. PLEASE READ RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES CAREFULLY.</p>
    <p><b>Please read these Terms carefully before you start to use the Website, and before you make a contribution to DefendCrypto.</b></p>

    <p><b>Governing Law</b></p>
    <p>This agreement is governed by the laws of Ontario and all users hereby attorn to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of Ontario. All contents of the Website are copyright protected and may not be reproduced in any form without prior written permission. However, you may download and save individual pages for your own personal, non-commercial use Except as prohibited by applicable law, these Terms are governed by the laws of Ontario, Canada and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, aside from its conflict of laws principles. Where the Terms allow claims to be resolved in Court, you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Toronto, Ontario, Canada for the purpose of litigating all claims or disputes related to injunctions sought by us or other equitable relief to protect our intellectual property rights in any court of competent jurisdiction. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement..</p>
    <p><b>Resolution of Disputes</b></p>
    <p><b>(a) Mandatory Arbitration.</b> Any dispute or claim between you and us relating to or arising out of the Website or the Terms (except for small claims court matters or the injunctive or other equitable relief mentioned in Section 16 above), will be referred to and determined exclusively through binding confidential arbitration conducted in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, unless you are a resident of the United States, in which case the arbitration will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless the parties agree otherwise.</p>
    <p>The arbitration will be held on an individual basis, before a single arbitrator and in accordance with the applicable Ontario arbitration statute (the Arbitration Act, 1991, S.O. 1991, c.17, as amended, or the International Commercial Arbitration Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.9, as amended, or such other statute that may be enacted). The arbitration will not be open to the public or media and all evidence discovered or submitted is confidential and may not be publicly disclosed, except as needed to enforce an arbitral award.</p>
    <p>Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the arbitration rules. You and Kik Group may also take claims to small claims court in Toronto, Ontario, Canada if the dispute qualifies for hearing by that court. BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT TO ASSERT ANY CLAIMS, EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT.</p>
    <p>You and Kik Group also agree that: (i) you and Kik Group will each pay such portion of the costs of the arbitration (which consists of each party’s legal expenses, the fees and expenses of the arbitrator, and any other expenses related to the arbitration) as determined by the arbitrator; (ii) the arbitrator may, in making an award of costs, consider whether costs are prohibitive compared to litigating in a court, and may require Kik Group to pay a greater portion of the fees and expenses of the arbitrator, or the travel expenses of you or any witness, in which case Kik Group will pay as much of your arbitration costs as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent such cost-prohibitiveness; (iii) the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; (iv) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law; and (v) the arbitrator’s award will be final and non-appealable, but may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
    <p><b>(b) Jury Trial Waiver.</b> THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and Kik Group in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND KIK GROUP WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>
    <p><b>(c) Class Action Waiver.</b> THE ARBITRATION WILL BE CONDUCTED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF.</p>
    <p><b>(d) Right to Opt Out.</b> You have the right to opt out of this agreement to arbitrate by sending written notice of your decision to opt out, postmarked within 30 days of the date this Agreement, to the address listed in Section 9 (above). Your written notice must include your Kik username and the email address you used to sign up with your Kik account. If you send written notice, then the mandatory arbitration provisions in this Agreement will not apply to you or Kik Group. IF YOU DO NOT SEND THIS WRITTEN NOTICE, THEN YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS IN THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
    <p><b>Limitation on Time to File Claims</b></p>
